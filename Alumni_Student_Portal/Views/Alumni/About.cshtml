Education is more than just learning facts; it is learning how to learn. It is not only getting answers, but also learning what questions to ask. Yes, classes, books, research, tests, exams, degrees – these are all important; but as a means, not an end. In the final analysis, what we hope for is not only knowledge and learning, but wisdom.</p>
